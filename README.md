# nocon-db

NoSQL local file storage with constraints -- unique keys, null check and indexing, akin to SQLite, with API similar to [liteorm](https://github.com/patarapolw/liteorm). Powered by TypeScript decorators and interface. Also with async event-emitter, thanks to [emittery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emittery).

Can save as BSON with `bsonAdapter`.
